								<h2>About Me</h2>
							</header>

							<p>I feel that I had a privileged childhood to be able to grow up in a small Victorian country town, Mildura to parents who were horticulturists. Both my parents have a Croatian background with Dad’s parents arriving in Australia in the 1930s and Mum’s parents arriving in the 1940s. Both grandparents set up base in Adelaide and then found their ground in Mildura at the top of Victoria where my Mum and Dad met. Although my parents spoke Croatian, I could not, except the odd swear 	words shared with my cousins! My family had a vineyard where it produced a variety of grapes. The vine yard provided freedom for my imagination and hours of joy working on the property throughout the year with my other three siblings.</p>
								<p>I completed all my Primary and Secondary education in Mildura, completing VCE in 2001. I then was fortunate to move to Melbourne to complete and attain a Diploma in Telecommunications at RMIT in 2004. Over the years I have also completed a few online IT training courses for work and presently I have started a Degree in IT. </p>
									<p>Apart from my interest in IT, I am an avid Drummer. I have played the Drums since I was seven, and have also taught the drums to students at High School. I have been in a number of (unknown) bands which have toured Australia and released a number of Albums onto the Wide World Web.</p>

								<h2>Intrest in IT</h2>
							</header>

							<p>Personally, my interest in IT is in the fact that enabled hardware can be connected in a way to provide instant communications to others.
								<p>IT has been embedded into me from an early age by my Grandfather who worked with computers and telecommunications during his career. Ever since that exposure, I have pursued knowledge into how things work, what makes them work, why and how things can talk to each other and how things came to be. Over the last two decades, I have been passionate about building Computer systems, Maintaining Hardware, System Administration, Networking and encapsulating all these elements into home and work networks, hosting game servers and providing advice for family and friends.</p>
									<p>Ever since I started to think about higher education during my VCE, RMIT has always been highly recommended and at the top of my list of institutions for completing a university degree. As I have also completed a Diploma of Telecommunications from RMIT I am familiar with the requirements  of completed a course and know I will be provided the support I need. </p>
										<p>From completing the Degree in Information Technology I am hoping to be provided exposure to areas of the Information Technology world I currently have not been exposed too. Many of the subjects in this degree will allow me to gain an intimate insight into the inner workings of the IT industry and build my knowledge for any future career aspirations. </p>

								<p> Ideal Job Online Version - <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/51056299?type=standout#searchRequestToken=142d24c6-fa3c-4fcc-8ef4-ac0d8b1b6ac6">Network Engineer</a></li>
									<p> Ideal Job Offline Version - <a href="images/job.jpg"> Network Engineer</a>

										<p> This role is in the Service Operations Command Centre (SOCC) of Vocus. Team members constantly maintain the operation, maintenance and network facilities of the Vocus network. SOCC also provide customer interactions in regards to wholesale and retail services that are subscribed to the Vocus network. SOCC members need to maintain the security of the network with monitoring packets to determine whether they are friend or foe all within company standards and raising incidents when they arise. Network engineering has always been intriguing to me as well as being close to my heart after completing my Diploma in Telecommunications. Being able to manage a network on this scale would be a daunting task but I would enjoy the challenge every minute presented as it would be a dynamic world. </P>
											<p>The skills required for this job would be to have a deep understanding of the mechanisms of telecommunications in both IT and broadband internet. I have at least three years technical experience in the telecommunications industry and prior experience and knowledge including Internet Protocol(IP)/Multi-protocol Label Switching(MPLS) topology. I am also qualified in ITIL Foundation and have the ability to work individually as well as providing support for other team members. The role would also require knowledge of the Standards relating to the industry. Managing a fluctuating workload, prioritising tasks as well as adapting to deadlines whilst putting the customers needs first are also strong components of the role. </p>
											<p>Experience and training from a previous position in a Security Operations Centre (SOC), has ensured that I have an intimate and thorough knowledge of Industry Standards, a System Administration role, and an understanding of the Telecommunications Industry.  I also have knowledge of ITIL foundations. </P>
												<p>Although I have some of the experience and knowledge required, there are some areas in which I can improve and expand upon. This degree will allow me to have comprehensive understanding of a dynamic workload, putting demand on my work/life balance, working with teams, gaining intimate knowledge within the IT realm also it may allow me to get used to a 24/7, 365 shift work roster. </p>

								<h2>Profile</h2>
							</header>

							<p>After conducting the Myers-Briggs test it stated I was a ‘Virtuoso’ meaning, I love to explore using my hands, eyes, and enjoy touching and examining the world around me. Containing a cool rationalism and spirited curiosity, this personality type are natural Makers, move from Project to Project and learn from their environment as they go.</p>
							<ul>
							<li><div style="text-align:left">67% Introverted</div></li>
							<li><div style="text-align:left">77% Observant</div></li>
							<li><div style="text-align:left">60% Thinking</div></li>
							<li><div style="text-align:left">56% Prospecting</div></li>
							<li><div style="text-align:left">88% Assertive</div></li>
						</ul>
								<p>The results of my online learning style test, advised that I was a Visual learner. Meaning I learn by reading or seeing pictures, and understand and remember things by sight. I tend to picture what I am learning in my head and best learn by using methods that are primarily visual.</p>
								<ul>
								<li><div style="text-align:left">35% Auditory</div></li>
								<li><div style="text-align:left">45% Visual</div></li>
								<li><div style="text-align:left">20% Tactile</div></li>
							</ul>
									<p>Thirdly I conducted a Creativity test. These results indicated that, ‘Creativity is separate from the real world for you and enriches you’.  When I am involved in a creative idea or task, I get a wonderful sensation that there are no limits and anything is possible. Being creative means having the chance to become one with what you create.</p>
										<p>Reading through these tests results, I found that some answers were a little flamboyant, however, the majority of the results ring true for me. I do enjoy hands on tasks and thinking things through as well as learning visually. I do engage in my creativity side quite often but do not get a limitless sensation. While drumming, which I use as a creative outlet, I do enjoy engaging with a crowd when they are enjoying songs I am playing.</p>
											<p>During the course of my life I have worked in many teams ranging from Bands to work collaborations. I feel my test results indicate: 1-Myer Briggs) I would be a rational leader for the team, inspiring them to think outside for the box for solutions to solves issues and ensuring the project was complete on time so we could start on the next one. 2-Learning Style) I would be able to help the team by presenting the issue in a visual form like a flow chart, giving guidance in the direction of the work flow. 3-Creativity) I would be able to inspire the team by presenting them with a different way of seeing dealing with an issue, a creative solution.</p>
												<p>When forming a team it would be great to have people of the same personality type as yourself but having other members that have different personalities can bring a new way of looking at things and may offer a different perspective to the project and goals to accomplish the task on time.  A mix of personalities in a team would be the most beneficial.</p>
